# CNN
Image classifier using tensorflow and keras

A convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep, feed-forward artificial neural networks that that is used for analyzing visual imagery.
This image classifier is using tensorflow and keras.
For more details and tutorials visit https://www.tensorflow.org/ for tensorflow and https://keras.io/ for keras.

After training and testing, we will save the model and then we will use that saved model to predict future results so that we do not have to retrain out model everytime we start out system.

The database that we are using can be downloaded from http://www.superdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Convolutional-Neural-Networks.zip. The dataset contains a total of 10000 images, half of cats and other half of dogs. 4000 is for training and 1000 is for testing for each class.
